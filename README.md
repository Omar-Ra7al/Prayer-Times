# Prayer Times Application

This is a simple and responsive web application that displays the prayer times for a selected location. The app fetches prayer times data using the **Axios** library and displays it dynamically using **Pure JavaScript** and **CSS**. The application includes a **light mode** and a **night mode** theme, allowing users to switch between these modes either manually or automatically based on the time of day.

- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive for all devices.
- **Dynamic Mode Change:** The mode change affects all the elements of the UI (text, background, buttons, etc.).
